# Tong
A Toy Programming language made to understand parsing and code generation with LLVM
This project is meant to help understand how parsing and code generation work.

## Goals

- Learn how to build a language from scratch
- Use LLVM to generate real machine code

## Features (WIP)

- Expressions and arithmetic
- Variables and functions
- If statements and loops
- LLVM code generation

## Requirements

- Rust (stable)
- LLVM
